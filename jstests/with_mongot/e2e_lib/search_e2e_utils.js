/**
 * This function is used in place of direct assertions between expected and actual document array
 * results of search queries, because the search scores (and therefore orderings) of documents can
 * differ for the same collection and query across different cluster configurations. The reason
 * search scores can differ is that the search score for a document is influenced by which other
 * documents are on the same rather than across all shards.
 *
 * This function allows the same test running across different cluster configuration to pass if the
 * documents are in a "close enough" ordering to what is expected.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} expectedDocArr The expected array of documents in the expected order. Each
 *     document must have a "_id" key uniquely identifying it. No duplicate keys allowed.
 * @param {Object[]} actualDocArr The actual array of documents that are being tested that they are
 *     in a "close enough" order. Each document must also have an "_id" key, and each id key in the
 *     expected array must appear in this actual array.
 * @param {float} tolerancePercentage A floating point number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that
 *     indicates by what percentage of the array length each document has an allowance to drift from
 *     its expected position by. i.e. Array length of 9 with a tolerance percentage of 0.3 means
 *     each document has an allowance of (0.3 * 9) = 3 positions. Note that the actual enforcement
 *     of fuzzing depends on the fuzzing strategy. For example, one strategy enforces that each
 *     document is within its individual allowance, whereas another allows documents to share their
 *     allowances in a global pool. Any tolerance greater than 0 will result in an allowance of at
 *     least 1. Other fractional numbers are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.
 *     WARNING: large tolerancePercentages (generally above 0.5) are discouraged as a random
 *     ordering of docs has a reasonable chance of passing the fuzzing.
 * @param {FuzzingStrategy} fuzzingStrategy one of a pre-set number of possible options that affect
 *     how fuzziness or "close enough"-ness is decided.
 *     'EnforceTolerancePerDoc': a drift allowance / tolerance in terms of number of positions is
 *     computed based on the tolerancePercentage and array length. Then, each document in the actual
 *     array is checked that it is within this allowance. If any document in the actual array is
 *     out of its alloted tolerance, the entire assertion fails.
 *     'ShareToleranceAcrossDocs': Similar to 'EnforceTolerancePerDoc' except that each documents
 *     drift / tolerance allowance can be shared with other documents by placing all the allowances
 *     in a global pool that all documents deduct from. This is useful in cases where the
 *     actual array is otherwise in a good order except for an outlier. This way the tolerance
 *     can be kept low, but an outlier can still be accepted, without opening up the tolerance to
 *     something needlessly large for all docs.
