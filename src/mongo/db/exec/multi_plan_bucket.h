/**

 * attempts to multi-plan the query corresponding to the plan cache key, it asks for one token per
 * candidate plan from the queryâ€™s plan cache key bucket.  If the tokens are available, the thread
 * receives them and proceeds. After finishing, it returns the borrowed tokens. If there are not
