# This suite is based on the concurreny_replication suite. It is used for testing that there is
# no feature parity issue between a replica set before and after it has been bootstrapped
# as a single-shard cluster as long as the replica set endpoint is enabled. When feature parity is
# achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the same as the set of tests disabled
# in the concurreny_replication suite.
